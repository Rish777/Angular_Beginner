package.json --> This file contains information about the project, including the project name, version, dependencies, and scripts. It's used by npm to manage the project and its dependencies, and can also be used by other tools and build systems.
node_modules --> This folder contains all the project libraries. It is used to store all the project dependencies, including the libraries needed to run the project. When you install or update a project's dependencies using npm, the packages are downloaded and stored in this folder. The node_modules folder is created and managed by npm, and is used by the project's build and run scripts to locate the necessary dependencies.
src_folder   --> This folder is used to store all the coding of the application. It is where the developer writes the code that makes up the application.
    app     --> This folder is used to store all the main application code. It is where the developer writes the code that makes up the main functionality of the application.
    asset   --> This folder is used to store all the static assets of the application. It is where the developer stores all the images, videos, fonts, and other files that are not directly involved in the execution of the application. These assets are used by the application during runtime, and are typically referenced in the code using URLs.
    environment     --> This folder is used to store environment-specific configuration settings for your application. It is often used to store different configurations for different environments, such as development, testing, and production. The application can load the appropriate configuration settings based on the current environment, allowing you to have different settings for different deployment environments.
    index.html     --> html code
    main.js        --> This JavaScript file is used to bootstrap the Angular application. It is responsible for loading the Angular application into the HTML page. This is done by creating the Angular root component and inserting it into the DOM. The `main.js` file is typically referenced in the HTML file using a `<script>` tag, and is executed when the HTML page is loaded. This allows the Angular application to start running and interact with the user.
    style.css      --> css code


package-lock.json --> package-lock.json is a file generated by npm, it records the exact versions of all dependencies in your application, including dependencies of dependencies. This ensures that when your application is deployed to another computer, the same versions of the dependencies are used. It is commonly included in version control, and it's used to replicate the exact environment of your application in another place.
angular.json      --> This file is used by Angular CLI to configure various aspects of your project, such as the build process, testing settings, and deployment settings. It provides a central location to manage configuration settings for your project, making it easier to manage and share settings between team members.
tsconfig files    --> Tsconfig files are used by the TypeScript compiler to control its behavior. They are used to specify the TypeScript compiler options, such as the target ECMAScript version, the module system, and the location of type definitions. Tsconfig files allow you to customize the TypeScript compilation process for your project, and can be used to configure different build targets and environments.
.browserslistrc   --> This file is used by the `browserslist` library to determine which browsers to target when building and optimizing your application. It is often used in conjunction with the `postcss` and `autoprefixer` libraries, which are used to add vendor prefixes to CSS properties to ensure compatibility with different browsers. The `browserslist` library reads the configuration settings from this file and uses them to determine which browsers to target. This allows you to specify which browsers are supported by your application, and ensure that your CSS is optimized for those browsers.
karma.config.js   --> This file is used by the `karma` test runner to configure the behavior of the test runner. It is used to specify which files to include or exclude, which test frameworks to use, and which browsers to run the tests in. The configuration settings in this file allow you to customize the behavior of the test runner to suit your specific testing needs.
polyfills.ts      --> `polyfills.ts` is used to provide polyfills for APIs or features that are not supported in all browsers. Polyfills are small pieces of code that can be added to a website or application to provide support for APIs or features that are not supported in all browsers. They are often used to provide support for newer JavaScript features, or to provide support for older browsers. The `polyfills.ts` file is used by Angular CLI to provide polyfills for APIs or features that are not supported in all browsers. It is automatically generated by Angular CLI, and is used to provide support for APIs or features that are not supported in all browsers.

Interpolation   --> 

Ques.   What is Interpolation?
Ans.    Interpolation is a feature in many programming languages that allows you to embed expressions into strings. When the program runs, the expressions are evaluated and their values are inserted into the string, creating a new string with the expressions' values interpolated into it. This is often called "string interpolation" or "expression interpolation". In many languages, you can use a special syntax or function to indicate that you want to interpolate an expression into a string. For example, in Python you can use f-strings, in JavaScript or TypeScript you can use template literals, and in many other languages you can use string concatenation or string formatting functions to achieve the same effect. Interpolation is a concise and convenient way to build strings by combining static text and variables or expressions.

Ques.   What cannot be achieved with Interpolation?
Ans.    With interpolation, you cannot perform control flow operations such as conditionals or loops. It is primarily used for string concatenation and expression evaluation.
